What can you do with Pyinterpolate?
===================================

PyInterpolate is designed as the Python library for geostatistics. It's role is to provide access to spatial statistics tools used in a wide range of studies. This package helps you **interpolate spatial data** with *Kriging* technique. In the close future you'll use more spatial interpolation tools.

Where should I start?

If you are first time here, we highly recommend to read introduction and learn about **Pyinterpolate** purpose. Otherwise it's a good idea to look into tutorials and quickly adapt code from there to your own projects.
