    Function predicts value at unknown location using Simple Kriging.

    Parameters
    ----------
    theoretical_model : TheoreticalVariogram
        Fitted theoretical variogram model.

    known_locations : numpy array
        The known locations: ``[x, y, value]``.

    unknown_location : Union[List, Tuple, numpy array]
        Point where you want to estimate value ``(x, y) <-> (lon, lat)``.

    process_mean : float
        The mean value of a process over a study area. Should be known
        before processing. That's why Simple Kriging has a limited number
        of applications. You must have multiple samples and well-known area
        to know this parameter.

    neighbors_range : float, default=None
        The maximum distance where we search for neighbors.  If ``None`` is
        given then range is selected from the Theoretical Model.

    no_neighbors : int, default = 4
        The number of the **n-closest neighbors** used for interpolation.

    max_tick : float, default=5.
        If searching for neighbors in a specific direction how large should
        be tolerance for increasing the search angle (how many degrees more).

    use_all_neighbors_in_range : bool, default = False
        ``True``: if the real number of neighbors within
        the ``neighbors_range`` is greater than the
        ``number_of_neighbors`` parameter then take all of them anyway.

    allow_approximate_solutions : bool, default=False
        Allows the approximation of kriging weights based on the OLS
        algorithm. We don't recommend set it to ``True``
        if you don't know what are you doing. This parameter can be useful
        when you have clusters in your dataset,
        that can lead to singular or near-singular matrix creation.

    Returns
    -------
    : numpy array
        ``[predicted value, variance error, longitude (x), latitude (y)]``

    Raises
    ------
    RunetimeError
        Singular matrix in Kriging system.
