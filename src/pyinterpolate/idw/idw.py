    """
    Inverse Distance Weighting with a given set of points and
    the unknown location.

    Parameters
    ----------
    known_locations : numpy array
        The MxN array, where **M** is a number of rows (points) and **N**
        is the number of columns, where the last column represents a value
        observed in a known point. (It could be **(N-1)**-dimensional data).

    unknown_location : Iterable
        Array or list with coordinates of the unknown point.
        Its length is N-1 (number of dimensions). The unknown
        location `shape` should be the same as the ``known_points``
        parameter `shape`, if not, then new dimension
        is added once - vector of points ``[x, y]``
        becomes ``[[x, y]]`` for 2-dimensional data.

    no_neighbors : int, default = -1
        If default value **(-1)** then all known points will be used to
        estimate value at the unknown location.
        Can be any number within the limits ``[2, len(known_points)]``,

    power : float, default = 2.
        Power value must be larger or equal to 0. It controls weight
        assigned to each known point. Larger power means
        stronger influence of the closest neighbors, but it decreases faster.

    Returns
    -------
    result : float
        The estimated value.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        Power parameter set to be smaller than 0.

    ValueError
        Less than 2 neighbours or more than the number of ``known_points``
        neighbours are given in the ``number_of_neighbours`` parameter.
