abstract="Random function models and kriging constitute the core of the geostatistical methods created by Georges Matheron in the 1960s and further developed at the research center he created in 1968 at Ecole des Mines de Paris, Fontainebleau. Initially developed to avoid bias in the estimation of the average grade of mining panels delimited for their exploitation, kriging received progressively applications in all domains of natural resources evaluation and earth sciences, and more recently in completely new domains, for example, the design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE). While the basic theory of kriging is rather straightforward, its application to a large diversity of situations requires extensions of the random function models considered and sound solutions to practical problems. This chapter presents the origins of kriging as well as the development of its theory and its applications along the last fifty years. More details are given for methods presently in development to efficiently handle kriging in situations with a large number of data and a nonstationary behavior, notably the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximation and the stochastic partial differential (SPDE) approach, with a synthetic case study concerning the latter.",

abstract = "This paper discusses advantages and shortcomings of the S environment for multivariable geostatistics, in particular when extended with the gstat package, an extension package for the S environments (R, S-Plus). The gstat S package provides multivariable geostatistical modelling, prediction and simulation, as well as several visualisation functions. In particular, it makes the calculation, simultaneous fitting, and visualisation of a large number of direct and cross (residual) variograms very easy. Gstat was started 10 years ago and was released under the GPL in 1996; gstat.org was started in 1998. Gstat was not initially written for teaching purposes, but for research purposes, emphasising flexibility, scalability and portability. It can deal with a large number of practical issues in geostatistics, including change of support (block kriging), simple/ordinary/universal (co)kriging, fast local neighbourhood selection, flexible trend modelling, variables with different sampling configurations, and efficient simulation of large spatially correlated random fields, indicator kriging and simulation, and (directional) variogram and cross variogram modelling. The formula/models interface of the S language is used to define multivariable geostatistical models. This paper introduces the gstat S package, and discusses a number of design and implementation issues. It also draws attention to a number of papers on integration of spatial statistics software, GIS and the S environment that were presented on the spatial statistics workshop and sessions during the conference Distributed Statistical Computing 2003."

abstract = {After the important work performed by Matheron (1981), the theoretical link between spline interpolation and kriging now is clear. Spline interpolation is equivalent to kriging with fixed covariance and degree of polynomial trend. Usually kriging is performed in two steps, a structural analysis, which fits a covariance and a degree of trend to the variable under study, then the interpolation itself, which uses the results of the structural analysis. With spline interpolation, no preliminary structural analysis is performed. The covariance and degree of trend do not depend on the variable under study. This should result in a loss of accuracy of splines compared to kriging. Here, we compare both methods, first in a theoretical point of view, then using a practical example.}
