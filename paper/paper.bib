abstract="Random function models and kriging constitute the core of the geostatistical methods created by Georges Matheron in the 1960s and further developed at the research center he created in 1968 at Ecole des Mines de Paris, Fontainebleau. Initially developed to avoid bias in the estimation of the average grade of mining panels delimited for their exploitation, kriging received progressively applications in all domains of natural resources evaluation and earth sciences, and more recently in completely new domains, for example, the design and analysis of computer experiments (DACE). While the basic theory of kriging is rather straightforward, its application to a large diversity of situations requires extensions of the random function models considered and sound solutions to practical problems. This chapter presents the origins of kriging as well as the development of its theory and its applications along the last fifty years. More details are given for methods presently in development to efficiently handle kriging in situations with a large number of data and a nonstationary behavior, notably the Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approximation and the stochastic partial differential (SPDE) approach, with a synthetic case study concerning the latter.",
