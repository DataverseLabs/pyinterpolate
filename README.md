PyInterpolate
========

PyInterpolate is designed as the Python library for geostatistics. It's role is to provide access to spatial statistics tools used in a wide range of studies. This package helps you **interpolate spatial data** with *Kriging* technique. In the close future you'll use more spatial interpolation tools.

If youâ€™re:

- GIS expert,
- geologist,
- mining engineer,
- ecologist,
- public health specialist,
- data scientist.

Then this package may be useful for you. You could use it for:

- spatial interpolation and spatial prediction,
- alone or with machine learning libraries,
- for point and areal datasets.

Pyinterpolate allows you to perform:

1. Ordinary Kriging and Simple Kriging (spatial interpolation from points),
2. Centroid-based Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation from blocks and areas),
3. Area-to-area and Area-to-point Poisson Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation and data deconvolution from areas to points).

How it works
--------------

Package allows o perform multiple spatial interpolation tasks. The flow of analysis is usually the same for each interpolation method:

**[1.]** Read and prepare data.

```python
from pyinterpolate.io import read_point_data

point_data = read_point_data('xyz_txt_file.txt')
```

**[2.]** Analyze data, Semivariance calculation.

```python
from pyinterpolate.semivariance import calculate_semivariance

search_radius = 0.01
max_range = 0.32

experimental_semivariogram = calculate_semivariance(
	data=point_data,
	step_size=search_radius,
	max_range=max_range)
```

**[3.]** Data transformation, theoretical semivariogram.

```python
from pyinterpolate.semivariance import TheoreticalSemivariogram
semivar = TheoreticalSemivariogram(points_array=point_data, empirical_semivariance=experimental_semivariogram)
number_of_ranges = 32

semivar.find_optimal_model(weighted=False, number_of_ranges=number_of_ranges)
```

**[4.]** Interpolation.

```python
from pyinterpolate.kriging import Krige

model = Krige(semivariogram_model=semivar, known_points=point_data)
unknown_point = (12.1, -5.9)

ok_pred = model.ordinary_kriging(unknown_location=unknown_point, number_of_neighbours=32)
```

**[5.]** Error and uncertainty analysis.

```python
real_val = 10  # Some real, known observation at a given point
squared_error = (real_val - ok_pred[0])**2
print(squared_error)
```

```bash
>> 48.72
```

With **pyinterpolate** you are able to retrieve point support model from areal aggregates. Example from _Tick-borne Disease Detector_ study for European Space Agency - COVID-19 population at risk mapping. It was done with Area-to-Point Poisson Kriging technique from package. Countries along the world presents infections as areal sums to protect privacy of infected people. But this kind of representaion introduces bias to the decision-making process. To overcome this bias you may use Poisson Kriging. Areal aggregates of COVID-19 infection rate are transformed to new point support semivariogram created from population density blocks. As output we get population at risk map:

Status
------

Beta version: package is tested and the main structure is preserved but future changes are very likely to occur.


Setup
-----

Setup by pip: pip install pyinterpolate / **Python 3.7** is required!

Detailed instructions how to setup package are presented in the file [SETUP.md](https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/blob/master/SETUP.md). We pointed there most common problems related to third-party packages.

You may follow those setup steps to create conda environment with package for your tests:

### Recommended - conda installation

[1.] First install system dependencies to use package (```libspatialindex_c.so```):

LINUX:

```
sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev
```

MAC OS:

```
brew install spatialindex
```

[2.] Next step is to create conda enviornment with Python 3.7, pip and notebook packages and activate your environment:

```
conda env create -n [YOUR NAME] -c conda-forge python=3.7 pip notebook
```

```
conda activate [YOUR NAME]
```

[3.] In the next step install **pyinterpolate** and its dependencies with ```pip```:

```
pip install pyinterpolate
```

[4.] You are ready to use the package!

### pip installation

With **Python==3.7** and system ```libspatialindex_c.so``` dependencies you may install package by simple command:

```
pip install pyinterpolate
```

A world of advice is to use Virtual Environment for the installation.
