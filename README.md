PyInterpolate
=============

PyInterpolate is designed as the Python library for geostatistics. It's role is to provide access to spatial statistics tools used in a wide range of studies. This package helps you **interpolate spatial data** with *Kriging* technique. In the close future you'll use more spatial interpolation tools.

If youâ€™re:

- GIS expert,
- geologist,
- mining engineer,
- ecologist,
- public health specialist,
- data scientist.

Then this package may be useful for you. You could use it for:

- spatial interpolation and spatial prediction,
- alone or with machine learning libraries,
- for point and areal datasets.

Pyinterpolate allows you to perform:

1. Ordinary Kriging and Simple Kriging (spatial interpolation from points),
2. Centroid-based Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation from blocks and areas),
3. Area-to-area and Area-to-point Poisson Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation and data deconvolution from areas to points).


Status
------

Beta version: package is tested and the main structure is preserved but future changes are very likely to occur.


Setup
-----

Setup by pip: pip install pyinterpolate / **Python 3.7** is required!

Manual setup is described in the file SETUP.md: https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/blob/master/SETUP.md We pointed there most common problems related to third-party packages.
