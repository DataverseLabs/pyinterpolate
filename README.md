# Pyinterpolate

**version 0.3.2** - *Kyiv*

---

Pyinterpolate is the Python library for **spatial statistics**. The package provides access to spatial statistics tools used in various studies. This package helps you **interpolate spatial data** with the *Kriging* technique.

If you’re:

- GIS expert,
- geologist,
- mining engineer,
- ecologist,
- public health specialist,
- data scientist.

Then this package may be useful for you. You could use it for:

- spatial interpolation and spatial prediction,
- alone or with machine learning libraries,
- for point and areal datasets.

Pyinterpolate allows you to perform:

1. *Ordinary Kriging* and *Simple Kriging* (spatial interpolation from points),
2. *Centroid-based Poisson Kriging* of polygons (spatial interpolation from blocks and areas),
3. *Area-to-area* and *Area-to-point Poisson Kriging* of Polygons (spatial interpolation and data deconvolution from areas to points).
4. *Inverse Distance Weighting*.
5. *Semivariogram regularization and deconvolution*.
6. *Semivariogram modeling and analysis*.

## How it works

The package has multiple spatial interpolation functions. The flow of analysis is usually the same for each method:

**[1.]** Read and prepare data.

```python
from pyinterpolate import read_txt

point_data = read_txt('dem.txt')
```

**[2.]** Analyze data, calculate the experimental variogram.

```python
from pyinterpolate import build_experimental_variogram

search_radius = 500
max_range = 40000

experimental_semivariogram = build_experimental_variogram(input_array=point_data,
                                                          step_size=search_radius,
                                                          max_range=max_range)
```

**[3.]** Data transformation, fit theoretical variogram.

```python
from pyinterpolate import build_theoretical_variogram

semivar = build_theoretical_variogram(experimental_variogram=experimental_semivariogram,
                                      model_type='spherical',
                                      sill=400,
                                      rang=20000,
                                      nugget=0)
```

**[4.]** Interpolation.

```python
from pyinterpolate import kriging

unknown_point = (20000, 65000)
prediction = kriging(observations=point_data,
                     theoretical_model=semivar,
                     points=[unknown_point],
                     how='ok',
                     no_neighbors=32)
```

**[5.]** Error and uncertainty analysis.

```python
print(prediction)  # [predicted, variance error, lon, lat]
```

```bash
>> [211.23, 0.89, 20000, 60000]
```

With **pyinterpolate**, we can retrieve the point support model from blocks. Example from _Tick-borne Disease Detector_ study for European Space Agency - COVID-19 population at risk mapping. We did it with the Area-to-Point Poisson Kriging technique from the package. Countries worldwide aggregate disease data to protect the privacy of infected people. But this kind of representation introduces bias to the decision-making process. To overcome this bias, you may use Poisson Kriging. Block aggregates of COVID-19 infection rate are transformed into new point support semivariogram created from population density blocks. We get the population at risk map:

## Status

Beta (late) version: the structure will be in most cases stable, new releases will introduce new classes and functions instead of API changes.


## Setup

Setup with *conda*: `conda install -c conda-forge pyinterpolate`

Setup with *pip*: `pip install pyinterpolate`

Detailed instructions on how to install the package are presented in the file [SETUP.md](https://github.com/DataverseLabs/pyinterpolate/blob/main/SETUP.md). We pointed out there most common problems related to third-party packages.

You may follow those setup steps to create a *conda* environment with the package for your work:

### Recommended - conda installation

[1.] Create conda environment with Python >= 3.8. Recommended is Python 3.10.

```shell
conda create -n [YOUR ENV NAME] -c conda-forge python=3.10 pyinterpolate
```

[2.] Activate environment.

```
conda activate [YOUR ENV NAME]
```

[3.] You are ready to use the package!

### pip installation

With **Python>=3.7** and system ```libspatialindex_c.so``` dependencies you may install package by simple command:

```
pip install pyinterpolate
```

A world of advice, you should **always** use Virtual Environment for the installation. You may consider using PipEnv too.

## Tests and contribution

All tests are grouped in the `test` directory. If you would like to contribute, then you won't avoid testing, but it is described step-by-step here: [CONTRIBUTION.md](https://github.com/DataverseLabs/pyinterpolate/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md)
