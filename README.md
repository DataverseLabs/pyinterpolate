**version 0.2.5** - *Huygens Crater*
---------------------------------------

PyInterpolate is designed as the Python library for geostatistics. Its role is to provide access to spatial statistics tools used in many studies. This package helps you **interpolate spatial data** with the *Kriging* technique.

If youâ€™re:

- GIS expert,
- geologist,
- mining engineer,
- ecologist,
- public health specialist,
- data scientist.

Then this package may be helpful for you. You could use it for:

- spatial interpolation and spatial prediction,
- alone or with machine learning libraries,
- for point and areal datasets.

Pyinterpolate allows you to perform:

1. Ordinary Kriging and Simple Kriging (spatial interpolation from points),
2. Centroid-based Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation from blocks and areas),
3. Area-to-area and Area-to-point Poisson Kriging of Polygons (spatial interpolation and data deconvolution from areas to points).

How it works
--------------

The package performs multiple spatial interpolation tasks. The flow of analysis is usually the same for each interpolation method:

**[1.]** Read and prepare data.

```python
from pyinterpolate.io_ops import read_point_data

point_data = read_point_data('xyz_txt_file.txt')
```

**[2.]** Analyze data, Semivariance calculation.

```python
from pyinterpolate.semivariance import calculate_semivariance

search_radius = 0.01
max_range = 0.32

experimental_semivariogram = calculate_semivariance(
	data=point_data,
	step_size=search_radius,
	max_range=max_range)
```

**[3.]** Data transformation, theoretical semivariogram.

```python
from pyinterpolate.semivariance impJezero Craterort TheoreticalSemivariogram
semivar = TheoreticalSemivariogram(points_array=point_data, empirical_semivariance=experimental_semivariogram)
number_of_ranges = 32

semivar.find_optimal_model(weighted=False, number_of_ranges=number_of_ranges)
```

**[4.]** Interpolation.

```python
from pyinterpolate.kriging import Krige

model = Krige(semivariogram_model=semivar, known_points=point_data)
unknown_point = (12.1, -5.9)

ok_pred = model.ordinary_kriging(unknown_location=unknown_point, number_of_neighbours=32)
```

**[5.]** Error and uncertainty analysis.

```python
real_val = 10  # Some real, known observation at a given point
squared_error = (real_val - ok_pred[0])**2
print(squared_error)
```

```bash
>> 48.72
```

With **pyinterpolate**, you can retrieve the point support model from areal aggregates. Example from _Tick-borne Disease Detector_ study for European Space Agency - COVID-19 population at risk mapping. It was done with the Area-to-Point Poisson Kriging technique from the package. Countries worldwide present infections as areal sums to protect the privacy of infected people. But this kind of representation introduces bias to the decision-making process. To overcome this bias, you may use Poisson Kriging. Areal aggregates of COVID-19 infection rate are transformed to new point support semivariogram created from population density blocks. As an output, we get a population at risk map:

Status
------

Beta version: the package is tested, and the main structure is preserved, but future changes are likely to occur.


Setup
-----

Setup by pip: pip install pyinterpolate / **Python 3.7** is required!

Detailed instructions on setting up the package are presented in the file [SETUP.md](https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/blob/master/SETUP.md). We pointed out there most common problems related to third-party packages.

You may follow those setup steps to create a conda environment with a package for your tests:

### Recommended - conda installation

[1.] First, install system dependencies to use package (```libspatialindex_c.so```):

LINUX:

```
sudo apt install libspatialindex-dev
```

MAC OS:

```
brew install spatialindex
```

[2.] Next step is to create conda environment with Python 3.7, pip, and notebook packages and activate your environment:

```
conda create -n [YOUR NAME] -c conda-forge python=3.7 pip notebook
```

```
conda activate [YOUR NAME]
```

[3.] In the next step, install **pyinterpolate** and its dependencies with ```pip```:

```
pip install pyinterpolate
```

[4.] You are ready to use the package!

### pip installation

With **Python==3.7** and system ```libspatialindex_c.so``` dependencies, you may install the package by simple command:

```
pip install pyinterpolate
```

**Always use Virtual Environment for the installation**.

Tests and contribution
------------------------

All tests are grouped in the `test` directory. To run them, you must have installed the `unittest` package. More about test and contribution is here: [CONTRIBUTION.md](https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/blob/master/CONTRIBUTION.md)
