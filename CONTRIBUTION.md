# Contribution to Pyinterpolate

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Discussing the current state of the code
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features
* Becoming a maintainer

## Where should I start?

Here, on Github! We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. We have Discord server too and it's available here:

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `dev` or from 'master' (preferably 'dev').
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests in the test package.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised" License] that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](https://github.com/szymon-datalions/pyinterpolate/issues/4)

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
- Be specific!
- Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
