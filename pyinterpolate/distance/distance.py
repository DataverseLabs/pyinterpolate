    """
    Function calculates distance between two blocks based on how they are divided (into the point support grid).

    Parameters
    ----------
    block_1 : numpy array

    block_2 : numpy array

    Returns
    -------
    weighted_distances : float
                         Weighted distance between blocks.

    Notes
    -----
    The weighted distance between blocks is derived from the equation:

    $$d(v_{a}, v_{b})=\frac{1}{\sum_{s=1}^{P_{a}} \sum_{s'=1}^{P_{b}} n(u_{s}) n(u_{s'})} *
        \sum_{s=1}^{P_{a}} \sum_{s'=1}^{P_{b}} n(u_{s})n(u_{s'})||u_{s}-u_{s'}||$$

    where:
    $P_{a}$ and $P_{b}$: number of points $u_{s}$ and $u_{s'}$ used to discretize the two units $v_{a}$ and $v_{b}$,
    $n(u_{s})$ and $n(u_{s'})$ - population size in the cells $u_{s}$ and $u_{s'}$.
