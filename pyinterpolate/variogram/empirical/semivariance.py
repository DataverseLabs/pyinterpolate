                Maximum range of analysis. Lags are calculated from it as a points in range (0, max_range, step_size).

    weights : numpy array or None, optional, default=None
              Weights assigned to points, index of weight must be the same as index of point, if provided then
              the semivariogram is weighted by those.

    direction : float
        Direction of semivariogram, values from 0 to 360 degrees:
        - 0 or 180: is E-W,
        - 90 or 270 is N-S,
        - 45 or 225 is NW-SE,
        - 135 or 315 is NE-SW.

    tolerance : float, default=1
                Value in range (0-1] to calculate semi-minor axis length of the search area. If tolerance is close
                to 0 then points must be placed at a single line with beginning in the origin of coordinate system
                and angle given by y axis and direction parameter.
                    * The major axis length == step_size,
                    * The minor axis size == tolerance * step_size.
                    * Tolerance == 1 creates the omnidirectional semivariogram.

    method : str, default = triangular
        The method used for neighbors selection. Available methods:

        * "triangle" or "t", default method where a point neighbors are selected from a triangular area,
        * "ellipse" or "e", the most accurate method but also the slowest one.

    Returns

    # Semivariance

    It is a measure of dissimilarity between points over distance. We assume that the close observations tends to be
        similar (see Tobler's Law). Distant observations are less and less similar up to the distance where influence
        of one point value into the other is negligible.

    We calculate the empirical semivariance as:

        (1)    g(h) = 0.5 * n(h)^(-1) * (SUM|i=1, n(h)|: [z(x_i + h) - z(x_i)]^2)

        where:
            h: lag,
            g(h): empirical semivariance for lag h,
            n(h): number of point pairs within a specific lag,
            z(x_i): point a (value of observation at point a),
            z(x_i + h): point b in distance h from point a (value of observation at point b).

    As an output we get array of lags h, semivariances g and number of points within each lag n.

    # Weighted Semivariance

    For some cases we need to weight each point by specific factor. It is especially important for the semivariogram
        deconvolution and Poisson Kriging. We can weight observations by a specific factors, for example the time effort
        for observation at a location (ecology) or population size at a specific block (public health).
        Implementation of algorithm follows publications:

        1. A. Monestiez P, Dubroca L, Bonnin E, Durbec JP, Guinet C: Comparison of model based geostatistical methods
        in ecology: application to fin whale spatial distribution in northwestern Mediterranean Sea.
        In Geostatistics Banff 2004 Volume 2. Edited by: Leuangthong O, Deutsch CV. Dordrecht, The Netherlands,
        Kluwer Academic Publishers; 2005:777-786.

        of Balenoptera physalus in the northwestern Mediterranean Sea from sparse count data and heterogeneous
        observation efforts. Ecological Modelling 2006 in press.

    We calculate the weighted empirical semivariance as:

        (2)    g_w(h) = 0.5 * (SUM|i=1, n(h)|: w(h))^(-1) * ...
                            * (SUM|i=1, n(h)|: w(h) * z_w(h))

        (3)    w(h) = [n(x_i) * n(x_i + h)] / [n(u_i) + n(u_i + h)]

        (4)    z_w(h) = (z(x_i) - z(x_i + h))^2 - m'

        where:
            h: lag,
            g_w(h): weighted empirical semivariance for lag h,
            n(h): number of point pairs within a specific lag,
            z(x_i): point a (rate of specific process at point a),
            z(x_i + h): point b in distance h from point a (rate of specific process at point b),
            n(x_i): denominator value size at point a (time, population ...),
            n(x_i + h): denominator value size at point b in distance h from point a,
            m': weighted mean of rates.

    The output of weighted algorithm is the same as for non-weighted data: array of lags h, semivariances g and number
        of points within each lag n.

    # Directional Semivariogram

    Assumption that our observations change in the same way in every direction is rarely true. Let's consider
        temperature. It changes from equator to poles, so in the N-S and S-N axes. The good idea is to test if
        our observations are correlated in a few different directions. The main difference between an omnidirectional
        semivariogram and a directional semivariogram is that we take into account a different subset of neighbors.
        The selection depends on the angle (direction) of analysis. You may imagine it like that:

        - Omnidirectional semivariogram: we test neighbors in a circle,
        - Directional semivariogram: we test neighbors within an ellipse and one direction is major.

        or graphically:

        - omnidirectional:

               ooooo
              oooxooo
               ooooo

        - directional (W-E):

              oooxooo

        - directional with some tolerance (N-S):

                 o
                 o
                oxo
                 o
                 o
