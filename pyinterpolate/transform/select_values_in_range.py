    Function checks which points from other points are within point range described as an ellipse with
        center in point, semi-major axis of length step_size and semi-minor axis of length
        step_size * tolerance and angle of semi-major axis calculated as angle of direction from
        NS axis (0 radian angle) of a dataset.

    INPUT:

    :param origin_point: (numpy array) single point coordinates,
    :param other_points: (numpy array),
    :param step_size: (float) current distance between lags within each points are included in the calculations,
    :param last_step_size: (float) last distance between lags within each points are included in the calculations,
    :param angle: (float) direction of semivariogram, in radians. Angle is rotated by PI/2 rad.
    :param tolerance: (float) value in range 0-1 normalized to [0 : 0.5] to select tolerance of semivariogram. If
        tolerance is 0 then points must be placed at a single line with beginning in the origin of coordinate
        system and angle given by y axis and direction parameter. If tolerance is greater than 0 then semivariance
        is estimated from elliptical area with major axis with the same direction as the line for 0 tolerance
        and minor axis of a size:

        (tolerance * step_size)

        ((1 - tolerance) * step_size)
